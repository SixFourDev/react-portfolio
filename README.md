## Project Overview

Welcome to my personal portfolio website! This project showcases my skills and projects as a web developer using React.js. The portfolio is designed to highlight my background, projects, and contact information in an interactive and visually appealing way.

## Features

* Multi-Page Layout
* Responsive Design
* Project Grid
* Interactive Project Tiles
* Resume Display

## Usage

To view my portfolio, simply go to https://sbrowning-portfolio.netlify.app and you will be presented with the home page which is the About Me page. You will see a brief overview of myself, also with buttons at the bottom of the page that links to my Github, LinkedIn, and my Twitter. The next tab is my Portfolio tab that includes six different projects that I've built, or created with a team (Cooker's Companion and State Reviewer) that you can click to view the deployed site, or also click the github logo to visit the github repo. The next tab is Contact, where a user is able to enter their name, email, and a message they'd like to send, however the user MUST enter an email or they will be notified to enter a valid email address. The final tab is my Resume, where the user is able to view my resume, but also are able to download with the styling I created! Enjoy!
